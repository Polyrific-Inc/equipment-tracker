# C++ Coding Standards

1. General Principles

- Embrace Modern C++: Utilize features from C++11 and newer standards to write clearer and safer code.
- Consistency is Key: Maintain consistent coding styles across the codebase to enhance readability and maintainability.
- Avoid Overcomplication: Strive for simplicity; complex solutions can lead to errors and are harder to maintain.

2. Naming Conventions

- Classes and Structs: Use PascalCase (e.g., MyClass).
- Functions and Variables: Use camelCase (e.g., computeResult).
- Constants and Macros: Use UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES (e.g., MAX_SIZE).
- Avoid Leading Underscores: Identifiers starting with underscores are reserved and should be avoided.

3. Code Formatting

- Indentation: Use consistent indentation (commonly 2 or 4 spaces).
- Braces: Place opening braces on the same line as the control statement.
- Line Length: Limit lines to a reasonable length (e.g., 80-100 characters) for better readability.

4. Functions

- Single Responsibility: Each function should perform a single, well-defined task.
- Parameter Passing: Use references or pointers appropriately to avoid unnecessary copying.
- Default Arguments: Use default arguments judiciously to simplify function calls.

5. Classes and Object-Oriented Design

- Encapsulation: Keep data members private and provide public interfaces.
- Rule of Three/Five: If a class requires a custom destructor, copy constructor, or copy assignment operator, it likely requires all three (Rule of Three). With C++11 and beyond, also consider move constructor and move assignment operator (Rule of Five) .
- Avoid Inheritance When Possible: Prefer composition over inheritance to reduce complexity.

6. Error Handling

- Exceptions: Use exceptions for error handling instead of error codes.
- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization): Manage resources using objects that acquire resources in their constructors and release them in their destructors.
- Avoid Empty Catch Blocks: Always handle exceptions appropriately to avoid silent failures.

7. Performance Considerations

- Avoid Premature Optimization: Focus on writing clear and correct code before optimizing.
- Use Appropriate Data Structures: Choose the right data structures for the task to ensure efficiency.
- Minimize Expensive Operations: Be cautious with operations that have high computational costs, such as deep copies.

8. Testing and Maintenance

- Write Testable Code: Design code with testing in mind to facilitate unit testing.
- Document Assumptions: Clearly document any assumptions or prerequisites for functions and classes.
- Regularly Review Code: Conduct code reviews to maintain code quality and share knowledge.
